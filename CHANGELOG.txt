Version 2.0.6 ->

- In the 'conduct survey' tool made it when you click on an option it gets larger and bold
- In the analysis frame made the 'save' option automatically come up with a name for your save file with: survey name - user name - date
	- made changes to the date processing such that the date is a global variable
	- added code that automatically fixes the QuesLoad.txt file if their is no 5th line (as in previous versions)
	- edited (in the analysis frame) the 'save' option so it only stores location if you press OK
	- Updated the creation frame and main menu so they also respond accordingly to the 5th line of the save file (and don't forget about it)
- Increased the question length to be 356 chars (allowing for about 7 lines for the question in surveys), the survey now recommends you reduce your questions if they are more than 256
- Increased intro line so it can be up to 256 chars.
	- made changes to code such that the intro line is moved upwards if the line is longer
- Fixed file reader bug (un-closed file reader) which was causing open surveys to not be able to be deleted
- Made export window automatically show exported survey name so user does not have to retype it
- Changed the survey conductor so it positions the label correctly when the only a single line of text is being used in the introduction
